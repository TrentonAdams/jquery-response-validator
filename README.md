jquery-response-validator
=================

jQuery plugin for validating ajax html responses.  It's a mixed-mash 
of JavaScript, jQuery, and the w3c-validator.

An MIT, Apache, or LGPL license attachment to this project are forthcoming.
I just haven't decided which one yet.

One requirement to play with this as is, is to store it on a web server
somewhere, and access the jquery-test.html from there.  For some reason,
javascript cannot load other js files from the local file system, due to
same origin policy.
